Another example of where a linear boundary would not work well is shown below. How would you draw a max margin classifier here? We could do it easily by hand, but we cannot draw a **straight line**. Luckily there is a fairly easy solution, which is denoted by kernelizing your problem such that you can solve non-linear classification problems. Here, we'll introduce kernels."

For large data sets, computation times can take considerable proportions."
